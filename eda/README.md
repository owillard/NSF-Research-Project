# **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Overview**

We conducted extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on two provided datasets, UDS and MRI. We created many single and multivariate plots to roughly visualize relationships between different variables and cognitive status. Our analysis identified several key variables that we then used to determine their potential impact on predicting a subject's diagnosis.

## **UDS (Uniform Data Set):**
**1. Demographic Clinical Information**
* AGE: Age of the subjects
* EDUC: Years of education
* SEX: Gender of the subjects

**2. FAS (Functional Assessment Scale)**
* TRAVEL: Difficulty with traveling
* REMDATES: Difficulty remembering dates
* BILLS: Difficulty writing checks and managing finances
* TAXES: Difficulty assembling tax records

**3. GDS (Geriatric Depression Scale)**
* MEMPROB: Memory problems
* DROPACT: Dropping activities
* WRTHLESS: Feelings of worthlessness
* BETTER: Feeling that other people are better off than you
* BORED: Experiencing boredom
* HELPLESS: Feeling helpless

**4. NPT (Neuropsychological Tests)**
* VEG: Test to see how many vegetables a subject could name in 60 seconds
* ANIMALS: Test to see how many animals a subject could name in 60 seconds
* TRAILA: Trail Making Test A
* TRAILB: Trail Making Test B
* CRAFTDRE: How well a subject was able to recall a story after 20 minutes
* MINTTOTS: Multilingual Naming Test total score

## **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):**
* LHIPPO/RHIPPO: Volumes of the left and right hippocampus
* LPOSCINM/RPOSCINM: Measurements of cortical thickness
* GRAYVOL: Volumes of gray matter in various regions
* NACCBRNV: Overall brain volume
