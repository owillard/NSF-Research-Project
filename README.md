# **Summer 2024 SoCal Data Science - Exploring the Distinctions Between Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer’s Disease - Group 5**

##### Authors: Julia Eng, Kent Tran, Olivia Willard, Ted Yoon, Wesley Zeng, Yen Phuong Lam, Yvette Vargas

With data on patients across different cognition levels, our research aims to distinguish between
Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) patients through predictive modeling. By leveraging easily accessible data from neuropsychological tests, depression and behavioral
surveys, and demographic information—compared to more complex and costly methods like MRI
scans and biomarkers—we seek to develop robust and easier diagnosis methods.

Through this approach, we strive to enhance the early detection and accurate diagnoses of MCI
and Alzheimer’s Disease—ultimately improving patient outcomes and aiding in the management
of this debilitating condition.
