# **Testing Overview**

To determine the variables with significant influence on cognitive status, we conducted a series of
statistical tests including ANOVA, Chi-Squared tests, and Paired T-tests. These tests were selected based 
on their suitability for different types of data and relationships. The significant variables identified 
through these tests were consistent with those highlighted during our Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). 
This helped us select the variables for our prediction model.
