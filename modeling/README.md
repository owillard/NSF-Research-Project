# **Modeling Overview**

Using the most significant predictor variables that were found through EDA and statistical testing, we then trained several types of models to predict the distinction between MCI and AD.

The models we trained included:
* **Logistic Regression**
* **Random Forest**
* **Single Layered Neural Network**
* **Support Vector Machines**
